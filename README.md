## How to install (for beginners):
1. Download & install [python](https://www.python.org/getit/). Make sure to check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" and click "Install Now"
 
2. Open a Windows cmd (command prompt) and type `pip install pyautogui pygame`. This will install the required python packages for the script.
   - If on KBM, use this command instead: `pip install pyautogui keyboard`
   - To open a command prompt: press the windows button -> type "cmd" -> hit enter
4. [Download the code](https://github.com/smallest-cock/RL-Custom-Quickchat/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract the zip file, & put the `example.py` file somewhere (the one that applies to you)
   - If you want to rename the .py file, do it before step 4
   - Edit the .py file to change quick chats, macros, etc.
7. Right-click the .py file -> Create shortcut
8. Right-click the shortcut -> Properties -> Target: -> add the word "python" to the beginning, so it looks like: `python "C:\Users\....."`. Click Apply.
    - You can also change Run: -> Minimized to have it start minimized
9. Leave the script running any time you want to use custom quick chats :)
