## How to install (for beginners):
1. Download & install [python](https://www.python.org/getit/). Make sure to check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" and click "Install Now"
2. Open a Windows cmd (command prompt) and type `pip install pyautogui pygame pyaudio SpeechRecognition opencv-python`. This will install the required python packages for the script.
   - If on KBM, use this command instead: `pip install pyautogui keyboard pyaudio SpeechRecognition opencv-python`
   - To open a command prompt: press the windows button -> type "cmd" -> hit enter
3. [Download the code](https://github.com/smallest-cock/RL-Custom-Quickchat/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract the zip file, & put the `example.py` file somewhere (the one that applies to you)
   - If you want to rename the .py file, do it before step 4
   - Put all the .png images (for the autoclicker) in the same folder as your .py file if you want to use the feature which enables custom ball texures in matches
4. Right-click the .py file -> Create shortcut
5. Right-click the shortcut -> Properties -> Target: -> add the word "python" to the beginning, so it looks like: `python "C:\Users\....."`. Click Apply.
    - You can also change Run: -> Minimized to have it start minimized
6. Leave the script running any time you want to use custom quick chats or custom ball textures in matches :)
   - Edit the .py file to change quick chats, macros, etc.

## Troubleshooting / Errors:
If the script isn't detecting your button presses properly, you may need to edit the `buttons` dictionary in your script:

![buttonslist](https://github.com/smallest-cock/RL-Custom-Quickchat/assets/48503773/9ccc127d-c148-463a-8992-cbc14e33e19a)

In order to find out which values to use for each button, run `button_value_tester.py` and press each button you want to test. It will give you the correct values.
