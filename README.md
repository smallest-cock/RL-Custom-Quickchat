# RL-Custom-Quickchat
Enables custom quick chats in Rocket League using controller macros

## How to use (for beginners):
1. Download & install [python](https://www.python.org/getit/). Make sure to check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" and click "Install Now"
 
2. Open a Windows cmd and type `pip install pyautogui pygame`. This will install the required python packages for the script.
3. Put the `example.py` file somewhere (the one that applies to your controller). Edit the file to change quick chats, macros, etc.
4. Right-click the file -> Create shortcut
5. Right-click the shortcut -> Properties -> Target: -> add the word "python" to the beginning, so it looks like: `python "C:\Users\....."`. Click Apply.
   - You can also change Run: -> Minimized to have it start minimized
7. Leave the script running any time you want to use custom quick chats
